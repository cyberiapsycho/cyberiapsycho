## Who is Cyberiapsycho? 🤔

Cyberiapsycho is inspired by Cyberpunk concept, reflecting my interest in technology. I'm not a professional coder; I focus on finance, marketing and advertising, UI/UX, printing and 3D desgin. While I enjoy discussing these things, I still aspire to enter the coding world as a junior.
