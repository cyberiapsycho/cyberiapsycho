## Who is Cyberiapsycho? 🤔

Cyberiapsycho, a name inspired by the Cyberpubk concept, is used to describe my passion about the network and technology. But I'm not a professional coder, more focusing on the UI/UX, printing and 3D desgin work. Also i do the markting work and finance(indeed my carreer). I'd like to talk about myslef, but it's a little pale. And i'd like to join the world of the code as a junior.
